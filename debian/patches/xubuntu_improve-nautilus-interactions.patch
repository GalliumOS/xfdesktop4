Description: Get/set _NET_DESKTOP_MANAGER_S<screen> atom
 This atom is used by at least nautilus, so don't start xfdesktop
 if it is set already. If it isn't, try to set it in order to
 prevent a later call to nautilus to override the desktop.
 .
 Not forwardable, because it's a hack/test for the current xubuntu
 development release. I don't know how it will affect other GNOME apps.
 I'll reevaluate its correctness/usefulness before the precise release,
 and decide whether to disable or forward it at that time.
